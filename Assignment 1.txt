1. How HTTPS works :
      *HTTPS uses an encryption protocol to encrypt communications.
      *The protocol is called Transport Layer Security (TLS), although formerly it was known as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
      *This protocol secures communications by using what’s known as an asymmetric public key infrastructure.
      *This type of security system uses two different keys to encrypt communications between two parties:-

  *The private key - this key is controlled by the owner of a website and it’s kept, as the reader may have speculated, private. 
                     This key lives on a web server and is used to decrypt information encrypted by the public key.

  *The public key - this key is available to everyone who wants to interact with the server in a way that’s secure.
                    Information that’s encrypted by the public key can only be decrypted by the private key.

  SSL - (Secured Sockets Layer) - SSL is a security protocol that provides privacy, authentication, and integrity to Internet communications.
            SSL eventually evolved into Transport Layer Security (TLS).

           *In order to provide a high degree of privacy, SSL encrypts data that is transmitted across the web. 
              This means that anyone who tries to intercept this data will only see a garbled mix of characters that is nearly impossible to decrypt.
         
           *SSL initiates an authentication process called a handshake between two communicating devices to ensure that both devices are really who they claim to be. 




2.  Diffrent HTTP method and how it works.

  Http methods which are commonly used to communicate with the rest Api are :-

	POST =   A POST request is used to send data to the server, for example, customer information, file upload, etc. using HTML forms.

	GET  =   The GET method is used to extract information from the given server using a given URI. 
	         While using GET request, it should only extract data and should have no other effect on the data. 
	         No Payload/Body required.

	PUT  =   Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content

	DELETE=  Removes all current representations of the target resource given by a URI

    
    We can also call it as CRUD operations 
	C-  create
	R-  Retrieve
	U - Update
	D - Delete.

3. Status Code :- It is a response issued by the server to the client request made to the server.
    
	1xx - Informational status
	2xx - Sucess
	3xx - Redirected.
	4xx - Client side error
	5xx - Server side error


4 Diffrent type of web communication protocols.

	1.Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
                 2.Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)
	3.Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP)
	4.Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
                 5.Internet protocols (IP)
 	6.File Transfer protocol(FTP)
	7.User Datagram protocol(UDP)
	8.Post Office Protocol(POP)
	9.Telnet
                 10.Gopher

 * Hyper Text Transfer Protocol(HTTP)- It is a stateless protocol. HTTP used for transferring data over a network. 
			             *Most information that is sent over the Internet, including website content and API calls, uses the HTTP protocol.

 * HTTPS :- It is referred as Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secured, HTTPS uses an encryption protocol to encrypt communications.
                  *The protocol is called Transport Layer Security (TLS), although formerly it was known as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
                  *This protocol secures communications by using what’s known as an asymmetric public key infrastructure.

 * SMTP :- It is reffered as Simple Mail Transport Protocol.SMTP is designed to send and distribute outgoing E-Mail.

 *TCP :- It is reffered as Transmission control protocol. It divides any message into series of packets that are sent from source to destination and there it gets reassembled at the destination.

 *IP :- It is reffered as Internet protocol.IP is designed explicitly as addressing protocol. It is mostly used with TCP. 
         *The IP addresses in packets help in routing them through different nodes in a network until it reaches the destination system.

 *FTP :- It is reffered as file trasfer protocol. It allows user to transfer the files over the network.

 *UDP :- It is referred as User Datagram Protocol. 
          *UDP is a substitute communication protocol to Transmission Control Protocol implemented primarily for creating loss-tolerating and low-latency linking between different applications.


5.  Single-Page Application
                -A single-page application is an app that works inside a browser and does not require page reloading during use.
	 -We are using this type of applications every day. These are: Gmail, Google Maps, Facebook or GitHub.

     pros:-    *It is Fast, as most resources(html,css,scripts), are only loaded once throughout in a lifetime of the application.
	 *It is easy to make mobile application as the developers can reuse the same backend code for web application and mobile application.
	
     Cons:-   *Compared to the “traditional” application, SPA is less secure. Due to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
	 *It is slow to download because heavy client frameworks are required to be loaded to the client.
	 
 Multi-Page Application -   Multiple-page applications work in a “traditional” way. 
			  Every change eg. display the data or submit data back to server requests rendering a new page from the server in the browser.
			  Clicking a connection may make another page open. In this way, every page should be included independently. 
     
     pros:- Since there are a wide range of pages, one catchphrase can be effortlessly composed on each page, not at all like in SPAs having just one page

     cons:- The development becomes quite complex. The developer needs to use frameworks for either client and server side.
               *Frontend and backend development are tightly coupled.
